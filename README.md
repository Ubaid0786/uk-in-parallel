# Kashmir University Parody Website

This project is a scrappy parody of Kashmir University’s results portal, built to mirror the absurdity students endure every semester. Whether it’s "results under processing" for eternity, random GPA fluctuations, or re-evaluation making things worse, this site captures it all. Features include a rigged marks verification tool, an AI assistant that mocks your academic struggles, a conspiracy theory generator explaining why your results vanished, and a constantly crashing server—just like the real one! If you’ve ever felt like your grades were decided by a malfunctioning vending machine, you’ll feel right at home.
